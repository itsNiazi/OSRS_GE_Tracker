# OSRS Grand Exchange Tracker

This project is a tool to search and view the prices of various items, that can be found on the Grand Exchange of Old School RuneScape.
The Grand Exchange in Old School RuneScape is a virtual marketplace where players can buy and sell various in-game items.

## Motivation

**Picture this**: it's the early 2000s, and you're sitting at your computer, immersing yourself in the magical world of Old School RuneScape (OSRS). For many of us, this game wasn't just a gameâ€”it was a portal to adventure, friendship, and nostalgia.
Thus, the idea for the OSRS Grand Exchange Items and Price Tracker was born. It wasn't just about creating a tool; it was about reconnecting with a part of my childhood and learning the ropes of developing with Next.js in a fun and engaging way.
